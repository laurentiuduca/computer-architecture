Let the following Verilog code samples:

S1.
b <= c;
a <= b;

S2.
b = c;
a = b;

Suppose that before executing the above sequences of code
we have the following, and we denote the status as S0:
b is 2 and c is 3;

Then, in Verilog simulator:
- if we execute S1 after S0 then b is 3 and a is 2.
- if we execute S2 after S0 then b is 3 and a is 3.
