# computer_architecture

The material in this repository represents the experience in HDL
that I have accumulated since I was a teaching assistant 
at University Politehnica of Bucharest, 
where a taught Digital Computers and Computer Architecture
laboratory classes.

I share it with you!

Have a great success,
